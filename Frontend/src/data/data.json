Lovely touches like the teabags, toast toppings and local area info.  Such a beautiful place to stay with stunning scenery, the view from the windows and spa were fantastic. The spa was just what we needed after a day of skiing! We also loved meeting Bernie and Ernie the sheep,  and Billie the dog.'"

We stayed at their accommodation for our weekend bike trip, and we have to say everything was beyond our expectation!! The place is very warm and cosy, just what you need after a long day at the mountain. It was lovely to hangout by the river and Patisserie too! The location is excellent if you want to explore the local tracks. We are returning next year!'"
